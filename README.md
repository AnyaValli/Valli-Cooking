# Valli-Cooking
A website hosting a wide range of vegan cooking recipies utilised by myself and my husband. We've shared a love of cooking for many years, and have regularly added new recipes to our repiroire. Keeping these achived in a paperless, orderly, easy to access manner has always been a challenge and both of us were tiring of an increasingly large collection of recipes in our email inboxes!
Valli Cooking aims to archive some of our favourite recipes so we are able to both independently access full cooking instructions on any device. Now I no longer need to ask Elliot for the 100th time how many ml of stock the risotto needs, and he doesn't need to ask me whether the garlic should be crushed or chopped- we can just check for ourselves!
This project is one I'll ideally be adding to for many years. Being able to have a full library of our cooking creations, alongside some dodgy photography, not only services a great practical purpose, but also can possibly be a future trip down memory lane. "What was that delicious cake you made for my birthday in 2022...?"

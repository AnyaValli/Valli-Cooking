                <li>200g risotto rice</li>
                <li>200ml white wine</li>
                <li>1 small-medium butternut squash, peeled and cut into bite-size chunks </li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>1 bag of sage leaves removed from stems, half chopped, half left whole</li>
                <li>1 litre vegetable stock</li>
                <li>50g butter</li>
                <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 pack chestnut mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 pack vegan chicken pieces</li>
                <li>50g vegan parmesan </li>

            </div>
            <ol>
                <li id="temp">Toss the squash in 1 tbsp oil together with the chopped sage. Scatter into a shallow roasting tin and roast for 30 mins until brown and soft</li><br>
                <li>While the squash is roasting, prepare the risotto. Bring the stock to the boil and keep on a low simmer. In a separate pan, melt half the butter over a medium heat. Stir in the onions and cook gently for 5-7 mins until soft but not coloured, stirring occasionally, then add the mushrooms and chicken, cooking for a further ~5 minutes. Stir the rice into the mix until completely coated in the butter, then stir continuously until the rice is shiny and the edges of the grain start to look transparent.</li><br>
                <li>Pour in the wine and simmer until completely evaporated. Add the stock, a ladleful at a time, and stirring the rice over a low heat for 25-30 mins, until the rice is cooked al dente (with a slightly firm, starchy bite in the middle). The risotto should be creamy and slightly soupy. </li><br>
                <li>At the same time, gently fry the whole sage leaves in a little olive oil until crisp, then set aside on kitchen paper. When the risotto is just done, stir through half of the butternut squash chunks, then add ¾ of the cheese and remaining butter and leave to rest for a few minutes. Serve the risotto scattered with the whole chunks of squash and the crisp sage leaves, dusted with the rest of the cheese. </li>

            <h3>Method</h3>
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre fry the chorizo sausages. Once they're crispy on the outside, remove from pan, slice into discs, then fry them again on each side until crisp.</li><br>
                <li>Pre-heat the oven to 200C. Slice the tomatoes into quarters and place into a large bowl, along with the (drained) jar of olives and chorizo slices</li><br>
                <li>Add into the bowl the olive oil, vinegar, sugar, and half a teaspoon of salt. Toss to coat evenly.</li><br>
                <li>Arrange tomatoes et al evenly across on two baking trays, giving them as much room between each as you can, and put the bowl to one side. <b>DO NOT WASH THE BOWL.</b> Put a sieve over it and set to the side. </li><br>
                <li>Roast for 40 minutes, rotating the trays halfway through to ensure everything cooks evenly, until the tomatoes are glossy and slightly charred. </li><br>
                <li>5 minutes before the tomatoes are ready, prepare the couscous in a saucepan - add salt, some bouillon, some extra seasoning of choice (paprika and a few strands of saffron work well), then pour in boiling water at a ratio of 1:1.5 (i.e. 270ml water to 180g couscous, although there's no risk to slightly overpouring by 10-20ml) and cover.</li><br>
                <li>Once the tomatoes are cooked carefully pour them, one tray at a time, into the sieve over the large bowl. Drain until all the flavoured oil ends up in the bowl. Save the first tray's worth of tomatoes et al for following meal. </li><br>
                <li>Once the second tray has been drained, keep the tomatoes et al that were on it warm however you can. </li><br>
                <li>Pour the liquid into a blender, then add the butterbeans and a teaspoon of salt. Blitz until it is the texture of hummus. Set aside half for following meal. </li><br>
                <li>Serve, by fluffing up the cous cous and spreading across both plates. Then spoon on the hummus, add 3/4 of the rocket, add tomatoes et al, then the rest of the rocket. </li><br>
                <li>Drizzle over with lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. </li><br>

            </ol>
